# sum-of-digits
You are given an array of  N N distinct numbers. Now, we call the Digit Value of a number to be the sum of its digits..  Now, a subset is a set of not-necessarily-contiguous array elements. We call the value of a set to be the the maximum over the Digit Value of all elements it contains.  Now, you need to find the summation of the values of all  2 N − 1 2N−1 non-empty subsets of this array. As the answer can be rather large, print it Modulo  10 9 + 7 109+7. Can you do it ?  Input Format :  The first line contains a single integer  N N. The next line contains  N N space separated integers, where the  i t h ith integer denotes  A [ i ] A[i].  Output Format :  Print the summation of the value of each non-empty subset of the given array Modulo  10 9 + 7 109+7.
